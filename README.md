resume
======

My resume, in its full TeX glory.

## TeX

This is an example resume written in LaTeX. More example templates can
be found
[here](http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/).

Make sure to put the files `res.cls` and `helvetica.sty` either in the
same directory as your own `your-resume.tex` or in your `$TEXINPUTS`
directory.
